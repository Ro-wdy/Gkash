# Latest Updates - Gkash Landing Page

## 📅 Date: October 28, 2025

### ✅ Changes Made

#### 1. **Color Scheme Refined** 🎨
- **Changed from pure white to soft light backgrounds**
  - Old: `#ffffff` (Pure white)
  - New: `#f5f7fa` (Soft light gray-blue)
  - Secondary: `#eef1f6` (Even softer light)
  
- **Why?** Pure white can be harsh on the eyes, especially for extended reading. The new soft light colors provide:
  - Better visual comfort
  - Professional appearance
  - Less eye strain
  - Still maintains the "light and clean" aesthetic

- **Cards now use white (#ffffff)** against soft backgrounds for better contrast and visibility

#### 2. **Language Updated** 👥
- **Changed "youth" to "people" throughout**
  - Hero subtitle
  - Statistics
  - Problem section
  - Features description
  - Impact section
  - CTA section
  - Footer

- **Why?** Makes the platform more inclusive and suitable for an MVP targeting a broader audience

#### 3. **Statistics Updated** 📊
- **Removed "1000+ Active users"** (replaced with "100% Commitment to your success")
- **Kept:**
  - 70% People lack saving habits
  - 50+ Financial lessons

- **Why?** MVP phase doesn't have active users yet. New stat emphasizes commitment instead.

#### 4. **Problem Section Visibility Fixed** 🔍
- **Added explicit positioning and z-index**
  - `position: relative`
  - `z-index: 1`
  
- **Enhanced card visibility:**
  - Cards now use pure white background in light mode
  - Increased shadow depth (0 6px 12px)
  - Better hover effects with pink shadow
  - Proper dark mode support

- **Why?** Section was being hidden when scrolling up due to z-index stacking issues. Now properly layered above hero section.

#### 5. **Feature Cards Enhanced** ✨
- **Better visibility in light mode:**
  - White card backgrounds
  - Subtle shadows for depth
  - Better contrast against soft page background
  - Dark mode specific styling maintained

- **Why?** Improved readability and visual hierarchy
